Plotting with Matplotlib
You have been hired by Pymaceuticals Inc., one of the leading pharmaceutical companies that specializes in anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. In your role, you will assist the senior scientist teamâ€™s effort to screen potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, with the other treatment regimens. You have been tasked by the senior scientist team to generate an initial drug regimen comparison and a summary of your findings.

For this assignment, you will go through the steps of a basic data analysis and then visualize the dataset by using a new type of visualization: a box and whisker plot. Although we have provided all of the steps required to produce each output, there may be some new concepts and terminology in this assignment. If you are ever stuck or confused, search for the terms online and check out the resource links we provide throughout the activity.
